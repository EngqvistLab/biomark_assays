To enable analysis of the microplate data using the same scripts developed for the FlexSix chip we arranged it in the a compatible layout. For this reason we also had to create "mock" `sample` and `assay` files. This is purely for the sake of script compatability. The data was aquired in a microplate format using a conventional plate reader.
