The power of the FlexSix chip lies in that it separately mixes all samples with all assays, resulting in a reaction "grid". To enable simple analysis of the resulting data settled on a format that requires the user to manually specify the input concentrations in terms of the sample and assay wells. For each analyzed dataset a `sample` and an `assay` file was manually created. These files list the enzymes and substrates used as well as their *final* concentrations (*not* the concentrations loaded on the chip). When calculating these concentrations we took into account the dilution that takes place when samples and assays are mixed.
